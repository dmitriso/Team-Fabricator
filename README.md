## Description
<hr>

<p>This was created using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Node JS. As a Command Line Interface program, the application was designed for the user to build roster of team members. When initiated the user is prompted through command line a series of questions. General information(name,role,id,and email) about the team member is asked. The user can then select wether a Manager,Engineer, or Intern is added to the roster. If one of the roles is assigned, then the user is asked for specific information related to that role. After setting the role and inputting the information, the user has the option to add more members until satisfied.  </p>
